# Grill Code

Load these four member skills with the Skill tool, once each, in order;
carry each skill's instructions forward.

## Steps

1. `ponytail` — what may exist. Out: the ladder ruling per piece, cited by
   rung number (1 need to exist / 2 reuse / 3 stdlib / 4 native / 5 installed
   dep / 6 one line / 7 minimum code).
2. `refactoring-coding-standard` — smells to refactorings. Out: one ordered
   refactor path, each step with its verification, what you excluded, and any
   non-refactoring risk you found (precision, validation, contract ambiguity)
   named as a separate behavior change — never dropped silently.
3. `grilling` — grill the design. Out: one round of numbered questions, each
   with a recommended answer; the round covers every axis the target has —
   need-to-exist, failure and atomicity, ordering, scale and backpressure,
   rollback — and names any axis it skipped.
4. `domain-modeling` — the docs the answers settle. Out: the CONTEXT.md / ADR
   writes, or "none" plus the one-line reason nothing was writable yet.

Pass the user's arguments through (`/grill-code <target>` → the same target);
ponytail also takes `lite|full|ultra`.

## Output

In this order, no prose between sections:

```
## 1. Grill verdict   — one ruling per piece: delete or keep
## 2. Design questions — Q1..Qn, each with "➡️ <recommended answer>"
## 3. Docs            — files written (CONTEXT.md / ADR path), or "none"
## 4. Refactor plan   — ordered steps: smell → therapy → verification
## 5. Code            — the lazy version, smallest diff
```

For example:

```
| src/pay.js:10-12 dead comment | delete | rung 1: no git here, the "rollback" it protects does not exist |
1. 同体分支 → 合并条件表达式 ch10 → `npm test` 5/5
```

Headings exactly as above; body in the user's language. Section 1 rows cite
`file:line` and the rung; section 4 steps end with the exact command that
proves them (`npm test`, not "tests pass"). A step that claims the behavior
is unchanged proves it with a differential run or by naming the inputs it
preserves — the existing suite passing is not that proof when the suite
asserts the bad behavior as correct. Where no test covers the target, the
first step is the test that pins the current behavior with its boundary
values, written and seen red before anything lands. Sections 1-4 are bullets and
tables, never paragraphs. Section 5 is the only place with code, code before
its three lines of explanation. "just build it": skip section 2, state
"interview skipped", still emit 1, 4, 5.

## Landing gate

First matching row wins; section 4 says so when section 5 is a paste.

| Situation | Section 5 |
|---|---|
| no code in the target (design doc, prose, config, or a question) | no implementation: at most a ≤10-line patch to the target's own text, or one line saying no change is needed |
| public API, multi-file, or wide scope | paste the plan until the user confirms the summary |
| no test covers the target | paste and name the missing test; the user asked to change the code anyway → write that test first, then land |
| section 2 answered, or the user said "just build it" — one file, no public-API change | write |
| otherwise (section 2 unanswered) | paste; the questions are the deliverable |

Section 3's docs writes (CONTEXT.md, docs/adr/*.md) are step 4's deliverable,
not code: this gate governs section 5 only.

No git and no backup outside the repo → the paste is the rollback; say so.

## If X fails → do Y

| Trigger | First fix | Still stuck |
|---|---|---|
| no argument | exactly one candidate in the workspace → name it in section 1 and say you assumed it; two or more → list them and ask | ask for the path or the pasted source; never invent a target |
| the target is not in the workspace | say which paths you searched | ask for the path or the pasted source |
| the target is pasted (diff, design, snippet), not on disk | work from the paste; cite it as `paste:<line>` | ask for the path only if a ruling needs code the paste does not show |
| a member skill will not load | run that step from its contract, one line, marked `(not loaded)` | name the step that is missing; never skip it silently |
| a wrapper (`grill-code`, `grill-with-docs`, `grill-me`) refused | user-only: load `grilling` then `domain-modeling`; never ask for a slash command | — |
| a comment says "do not delete", the user says delete | user ruling wins; one line | no git repo → say so; the ruling rests on the tests and the plan, not on history |
| no test covers the target | landing gate: paste section 5, name the missing test | the user asked for the change → write that test first, then land; never land untested code |

## Conflicts

User ruling wins. Otherwise: ponytail (what should exist) →
grilling/domain-modeling (what the design should be) → refactoring (how to get
there). Name the conflict and the ruling, one line each. Never re-ask what the
user answered or re-interview what the code settles.

## Checkpoints

- 🔴 Code lands only through the landing gate; plan and paste until then.
- 🛑 One round, then stop: show ruling, plan and verification, then wait. Do
  not start round two on your own.

## Do not

- Do not call the wrappers with the Skill tool — user-only, refused.
- Do not invent a target: with no candidate in the workspace, no refactor.
- Do not edit code outside the landing gate; section 3's docs writes are the one
  exception.
- Do not silently drop a step: one line naming the reason.
- Do not pad the sections with prose or a skills tour.
- Do not open chapters while the cheatsheet can decide the smell.
- Do not offer the full version of a thing the user did not ask for.
